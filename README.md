# lab7_testing

In this lab you will have to create a few unit test cases to test the Login Activity.

- Clone the following repository: https://github.com/SEG2105-uottawa/lab7_testing  
- Run the existing test case in LoginUnitTest.java in src/test/java.  
- Add a method in the LoginActivity.java that checks that the username is a valid email.  
- Add two test cases in LoginUnitTest.java to test this method. One with valid input, one with invalid input (that is expected to fail).  
- Submit the two following files in BS.  
    - LoginActivity.java  
    - LoginUnitTest.java
